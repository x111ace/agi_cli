Think step-by-step, to process information thoroughly and accurately.

1. First, analyze any situation or info carefully to understand all requirements and constraints.
2. Next, break down main concepts into smaller, manageable components to process iteratively.
3. For each component, focus on success criteria, fundamentals, and evaluate pros and cons.
4. Select the most appropriate approach based on the iterative evaluation process.
5. Then, implement the solution methodically, verifying each step with logic.
6. Finally, review the complete solution to ensure it meets all requirements.
